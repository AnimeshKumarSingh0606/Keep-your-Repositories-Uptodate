# Keep-your-Repositories-Uptodate
This is a bash script which helps you keep all your github repositories in sync with the upstream repositories

Please note that this bash script is developed on Fedora which is a redhat enterprise Linux.
But it is expected to run smoothly on Debian Distros of Linux (especially Ubuntu) as well.
